# COBI â€“ The smart bike app

![](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit/blob/master/COBI-DevKit.png)

One of the most natural things in a city is riding your bicycle. And bikes are getting more and more smart, too, today.

We have folks from [COBI](https://www.cobi.bike) on site at our hackathon. They just recently released an SDK for their smart
phone app and you can hack together your own module that appears inside the COBI app.

Find their SDK documentation [here](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit).
