![](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit/blob/master/COBI-DevKit.png)

One of the most natural things in a city is riding your bicycle. And bikes are getting smarter today, too.

We have folks from [COBI](https://www.cobi.bike) on site at our hackathon. They just recently released an SDK for their smart phone app so you can program your own module that appears inside the COBI app.

Find their SDK documentation [here](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit).
And here's the direct link to their [FAQ](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit/blob/master/FAQ.md)

Please do talk to the nice & cool guys from COBI during our hackathon if you have questions about their product, their app or their SDK
